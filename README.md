## To-Do / Next Steps

The following tasks are planned for future updates (sourced from `notes.md`):

### Style

- [ ] Inputs can be designed like in Flutter, Devin.

- [ ] Sonner hover state can have better morphing.

- [ ] Flex grow has some unreliable layout changes, let's review the Motion layout docs again.

### Functionality

- [ ] Realtime error handling for forms / check compatibility with server-side confirmation.
